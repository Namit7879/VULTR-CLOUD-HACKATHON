Project Documentation
Description
A comprehensive plan outlining the project’s goals, timelines, milestones, and deliverables.
    
    This project involves building a backend system that manages user authentication, tools, and their interactions.
    The backend will feature user signup/login with JWT authentication, as well as an API for fetching tool data (recommendations, trending, and random tools).
    The project will be divided into several phases, from development to testing and deployment.
    
Project Objectives
The project’s main objectives include:

    - User authentication with registration and login functionality.
    - Provide an API for fetching tool data, including trending and random tools.
    - Create a secure and robust backend using MongoDB and Node.js.
    - Ensure the application can scale and handle various types of users and tools.
    
Description of Deliverables
The deliverables for the project are:

    - A fully functional backend API for user authentication and tool management.
    - A well-documented API with detailed instructions for usage.
    - A GitHub repository containing the full source code.
    - A PDF report documenting the architecture, design, and setup of the project.
    
Architecture Diagrams
The following diagrams illustrate the overall architecture and design of the project.
    
    - **High-level architecture diagram**: Shows the components of the backend, including user authentication, tool management, and the database.
    - **Detailed component diagrams**: Illustrates the flow of data between components and how the APIs are structured.
    - **Network topology**: Outlines how the backend communicates with the database and other systems if applicable.
    
Technical Documentation
The technical details are as follows:

    - **System Architecture and Design**: The backend is built using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database. The system follows a RESTful architecture, with endpoints for authentication and tool management.
    - **Explanation of Key Components and Modules**: 
        - **Authentication**: Handles user signup, login, and JWT token generation.
        - **Tool Management**: Provides APIs for fetching tools based on categories (trending, recently used, etc.).
    - **API Documentation**: Detailed documentation for all API endpoints is included, including usage, required parameters, and example requests.
    - **Setup and Usage Instructions**: A step-by-step guide on setting up the backend, running the application, and making API calls.
